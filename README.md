- Learn to architect and develop Android apps in the Kotlin programming language using industry-proven tools and libraries. With these techniques you'll create apps in less time, writing less code, and with fewer errors.

This course was developed by Google together with Udacity. The course gives you hands on experience as you build real Android apps using industry best practices, with modern app architecture. You'll learn to use Android Jetpack components such as Room for databases, Work Manager for background processing, the new Navigation component, and more. You'll use key Kotlin features to write your app code more quickly and concisely.

Learning to develop on Android is much more than learning APIs and shortcuts. It's training your brain to think like a mobile developer.
